    "bio":  " I aspired to become a software developer while pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Application degree a few years back. My first experience with coding was at the university, and I found myself drawn to it. After completing my Post Graduation Diploma in Computer Application, and teaching as a computer teacher in India for about one and a half years, I moved to Australia in 2007 to pursue my Master of Information Technology. However, due to financial constraints and other obstacles, I struggled to focus on my studies and resorted to other work that was not related to my field. Fortunately, I eventually took charge of my education, began studying on my own, and attending online courses since 2017. To cut a long story short, I have been working as a software developer since 2019. I am confident in my abilities as a developer, and my responsibilities include working on coding tasks or stories for developing mobile applications and websites. I enjoy the diversity of my work, as I get to work on both front-end and back-end development with servers and databases. I always strive to learn something new, whether through my own research or by taking online courses, and I take great pleasure in the fact that there are always opportunities to broaden my knowledge in this dynamic field.",
