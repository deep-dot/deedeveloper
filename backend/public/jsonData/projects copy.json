These services are utilized to create a robust database infrastructure. The described scenario is particularly relevant for businesses requiring continuous uptime, such as e-commerce platforms that need their databases to be consistently available, secure, and capable of scaling on demand. The infrastructure outlined in this study not only secures the database within private subnets but also guarantees its high availability across multiple availability zones.",
